# Heuristics

Real-time automated fact-checking is hard, but not impossible.  There are a number of organizations such as [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/), [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/), [FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/), and [FullFact](https://fullfact.org/) that aim to reduce incorrect information in [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media).

## Goal

The goal for this project is to use existing technology to create a service that can score the "truthiness" of content based on specific criteria. This project will be open source to allow both transparency and open discourse on the [scoring model](docs/SCORING.md).

## Existing Projects

- [OpenSources](http://www.opensources.co/)
- [B.S. Detector](https://github.com/bs-detector/bs-detector)
